const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How do I know if I need professional help?",
    answer: "If your feelings of distress persist for more than two weeks, interfere with daily activities, or include thoughts of harming yourself, it's important to seek professional help. Remember that reaching out is a sign of strength, not weakness."
  },
  {
    question: "What resources are available on campus?",
    answer: "Most universities offer free or subsidized counseling services, peer support groups, wellness workshops, and crisis intervention. Check with your university's student services or health center for specific resources available to you."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I help a friend who seems to be struggling?",
    answer: "Express your concern without judgment, listen actively, encourage them to seek professional help if needed, and continue to check in. Remember that you're not responsible for 'fixing' their problems, but your support can make a difference."
  },
  {
    question: "Can exercise really help with mental health?",
    answer: "Yes! Physical activity releases endorphins, reduces stress hormones, and can improve sleep quality. Even short bursts of movement, like a 10-minute walk, can have positive effects on your mood and cognition."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I manage stress during exam periods?",
    answer: "Create a realistic study schedule, take regular breaks, maintain healthy habits (sleep, nutrition, movement), use relaxation techniques, and focus on what you can control. Remember that perfect preparation isn't possible, and your worth isn't defined by your grades."

const myths = [
  {
    myth: "Mental health problems are a sign of weakness",
    truth: "Mental health conditions are medical conditions, not character flaws. They result from complex interactions between biological, psychological, and social factors, much like physical health conditions."
  },
  {
    myth: "Stress is just part of being a student",
    truth: "While some stress is normal, excessive or chronic stress isn't healthy or necessary. Learning effective stress management is an important life skill that will benefit you well beyond your academic years."
  },
  {
    myth: "Asking for help means I can't handle college",
    truth: "Seeking help is a sign of strength and self-awareness. Successful students utilize available resources, and learning when and how to ask for support is actually a critical skill for academic and life success."
  },
  {
    myth: "Medication for mental health is just a crutch",
    truth: "For some conditions, medication is medically necessary and highly effective, especially when combined with therapy. Would you consider insulin a 'crutch' for someone with diabetes? Mental health treatments deserve the same respect."
